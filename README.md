# moodle-mod_cpdlogbook

This plugin is designed to provide a Continuous Professional Development logbook functionality to core Moodle.


# Installation

1. Install the plugin as you would any standard Moodle plugin via the Moodle plugin directory 
   (https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Installing_plugins#Installing_directly_from_the_Moodle_plugins_directory) or git cloning it into your source:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:brendanheywood/moodle-mod_cpdlogbook.git /mod/cpdlogbook
   ```
   Note that the plugin folder name must be `cpdlogbook` for moodle to recognise the plugin.

It appears like a reasonable plugin but as expected has a very outdated codebase.
